# SpeakEasy – Language Learning Web App

SpeakEasy is a simple and interactive web platform designed to help users learn new languages through engaging video lessons, interactive quizzes, and 24/7 doubt support. It is built using React.js and CSS and provides a user-friendly experience for learners of all levels.

## 🌍 What SpeakEasy Offers

SpeakEasy allows users to choose a language they want to learn. Once a language is selected, the platform displays a series of video lessons that are essential for understanding the basics and advancing in that language. All videos are arranged in one place to make it easy for users to learn without jumping around.

After watching the videos, users can take quizzes that are related to the lessons. These quizzes help them test their understanding and reinforce what they have learned. If users have any confusion or need help, they can use the 24/7 doubt support feature to ask questions and get assistance anytime.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- *React.js* – For building the user interface using reusable components.
- *CSS* – For styling the application and making it responsive on all devices.
- *React Router DOM* – For navigating between different pages like home, videos, and quizzes.
